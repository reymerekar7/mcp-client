# Sample Custom MCP Client Implementation

## Note, this is just a toy example of building a custom MCP client. 

There are 2 sample servers: Weather and GitHub with limited tooling.


To get this up and running:

To invoke the backend make sure you're in the root directory and run:
`uvicorn main:app`

To run the frontend:
`cd frontend`

`npm start`
